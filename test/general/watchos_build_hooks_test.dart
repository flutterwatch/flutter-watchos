// Guards what a package's build hook is told when it runs for watchOS.
//
// Two things are being held down. First, that a hook is told `watchos` — the
// platform it is actually building for — and not `ios`, which is what going
// through flutter_tools' own target translation would say, because its set of
// target platforms has no watchOS in it.
//
// Second, that it is told anything at all. The hooks protocol carries the
// target OS inside the *code* asset config, so a pass asking for data assets
// alone leaves a hook with no way to know. A package that picks a graphics
// backend from that — a 3D engine compiling shader bundles, say — then guesses,
// and guesses wrong: it compiles GLES for a Metal engine. Nothing throws. The
// app draws a black frame, which is why this is a test and not a comment.
